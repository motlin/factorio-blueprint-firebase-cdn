  "descriptionMarkdown": "The best solutions are the simplest. It is almost absurd how simple and cheap this is compared to how effective it is. I'm only 50 hours into this build but so far, no biter swarm has even come close to penetrating this barricade using only 2 lasers to take down any swarm and I've never lost a laser turret that had bot coverage. Curious if anyone has thoughts or suggestions.\n\nI didn't include the main wall or lasers because I want to tile this outside of the walls I want, therefore it rounds corners well too! Just place outside your walls with a pair of lasers and construction repair bots coverage and base penetrations are a thing of the past. Also because a large section of wall can be defended with only 2 lasers, it makes power requirements for defending a pretty large base/outpost very low relatively speaking. \n\n",
