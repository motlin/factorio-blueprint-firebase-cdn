To begin with, I'll tell you about the \"biter expansion\". Biter expansion is a biter behavior invented by the game developers, which forces the biter to build new nests near the player, preventing you from resting. You can cancel their expansion and regular bite attacks, you don't have to spend resources on turrets. To do this, you must capture an area that is larger than the current cloud of pollution, then install this cheap defense. Before installing the structure, you will have to press the F4 \"debug settings\" key, then find \"show-enemy-expansion-candidate-chunks\" in the list that opens. Your map now has a grid with circles. A green circle means that a new bite nest may appear in this place. Yellow circle - a new nest is unlikely to appear. The red circle is a place where a new nest will not appear. Build this structure in the area of ​​the green circle, the circle will change color to red (in-game value 0.100) to prevent the attack of the biters and the appearance of a new nest.\n\nBenefits:\n- Independence from man after construction.\n- Cheapness to operate and no need for regular maintenance.\n- Performs its function immediately after construction.\n\nDisadvantages:\n- lack of turrets",
