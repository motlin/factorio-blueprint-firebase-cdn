  "descriptionMarkdown": "This is a simple process that feeds the output of one Kovarex centrifuge into the next, and at set intervals releases some 235s into the Logistics network by way of a very simple circuit network.  It is meant to supply excess 235s to the logistics network over a certain amount of the contents in steel boxes.\n\n1)  At the start there are 2 requester boxes, the top one requests 235s and the bottom requests 238s.  From here the feeder arm loads the first centrifuge.\n2)  When the first round is finished the Uranium is ejected, the 235 on top and 238 below.  Since there is now less 238 than before, the requester box it is sent to only requests 3 so that the next centrifuge has the minimum 5 to operate with.  The 235 is ejected into a standard steel box as a buffer and at the same time another feeder arm pulls from that steel box into the next centrifuge.  Now, as the process goes around and around the number for 235s will start to increase more and more.  So much so that the feeder arm that takes from the steel box will have leftovers.  After there is a certain number of leftovers in the steel box, another feeder arm is activated and pulls the remainder to go on to a conveyor belt to the a passive provider meant to go to the fuel rod creation.  Currently I have each arm set to activate when the number of 235s is greater than 40, but it can be easily changed to a smaller number.  I wouldn't go much lower than 10 as sometimes a small delay or the stack inserter can cause the amount in the box to momentarily go higher than what is requested activating the inserter that pulls 235 out of the process. \n3)  This process continues down the line ending after the 5th centrifuge.  At the end the remainders take the conveyor belt back to the start to be processed over again.  As you can see this process can be easily extended to include more.  \n\nThe entire process is based on simple if-then statements used in programming: in this case - If the steel box still has 40 or more Uranium-235 Then move the contents to the conveyor to be used for Fuel Rod processing until the number in the box is less than 40. So long as there is a provider box supplying both the Uranium types, the entire process is fully automatic.\n\n*edit*  Depending on how quickly you want to generate extra 235 you can turn off the first requester chest and make it standard steel like the others and just manually drop 40 235s in.  Drop 'em and forget 'em.  This will result in each centrifuge running only 1 at a time while generating that extra 1, so that when it finishes at #5 there will be 5 more.  8 times through this process will net enough 235 to run 2 centrifuges at the same time.  8 more times and 4 will run at once.  Whereas leaving the requester set to 40 will result in a continuous pull having all running practically at once.  If you do not have many 235s I recommend changing it to the standard steel box.  If, like me, you forgot about the machines and had 8 running all at once for hours on end...  Well, my most common item in my logistics network is Uranium-235... 29K of them!  I think it is time to give my Kovarexes a break.  I am only running 8 nuclear reactors in a 2x4 setup.  I am actually quite short on the 238s at the moment thanks to forgetting about the machine turning my huge stockpile of Piercing Rounds magazine into Uranium rounds.",
