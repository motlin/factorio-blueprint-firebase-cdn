  "descriptionMarkdown": "It is very simple. I saw other peoples ideas of simple forges, and it was not primitive enough for me. I needed something early game that can be easily expanded. I came up with this and it passed my totally professional idiot test. \n\nI added two tracks (one on each side) that are meant for spacing out blueprints for expansion and also showing you where you could hook up your ore and coal inputs. For the roundabouts, it serves multiple purposes. I can put an inserter and chest inside to store extra materials and it also is a good indicator if you are producing too much more and need to cut down your miners. It also acts as simple storage that stores a few extra materials for if you need to cut production for a slight minute for alterations. I also have fast inserters used in the blueprint but feel free to use any electrical one. You may need to alter for coal inserters. You also DO NOT need multiple storage chests at the top to store the plates. One easily catches and stores all plates. I did it as such just in case it fills while I am AFK.\n\nI didn't plan on sharing this with the public, just posting it on here or my personal storage. Feel free to give it a try or let me know any alterations I could make to it for better efficiency. ",
