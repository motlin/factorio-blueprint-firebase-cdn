  "descriptionMarkdown": "## Description\n\nChainable, \"thrifty\" Kovarex processing. When properly 'primed', each blueprint will produce 1 piece of U-235 every 7.5 seconds.\n\nWhy is it called \"thrifty\"? Because the number of U-235 pieces 'trapped' inside the system will never be higher than the amount you use to prime it.\n\nWithout modules, it's as fast as a fully-beaconed Standard Centrifuge, but uses much less power (2.07 MW per Advanced Centrifuge compared to 9.55 MW for Standard Centrifuge + 12xBeacons, a saving of more than 7 MW)\n\nHere are some vids:\n\n* [A single unit running continuously](https://imgur.com/xHrjRTP)\n* [A pair of units running continuously](https://imgur.com/GvszbF7)\n\n## How to Deploy\n\n1. Paste **up to 4** of this side by side, making sure that the top belt of the left blueprint connects to the top belt of the right one.\n\n   As is. the topmost belt and leftward bottommost belts are unable to handle more than 4 chained units. If you want to deploy more units, you must replace those belts (and their splitters and tunnels) with a faster belt.\n\n2. Add a \"feeder/harvester\" mechanism to the left side of the chain. It must perform 2 functions: Extract U-235 pieces, and feed U-238 pieces (into one lane). Optionally, it would also re-feed the U-238 ejected by Kovarex into the top belt again.\n\n   For an example, see this image: https://imgur.com/ZwqrMzJ\n\n3. Feed  U-238 **on the lower lane** of the top belt. _**Important:** You must use a **single lane only** for the U-238 feed!_\n\n4. 'Prime' the Advanced Centrifuge with 80 pieces of U-235.\n\n## How to Control\n\nIf you need to control the unit(s), just enable/disable the top-left Fast Inserter of each unit. The Kovarex processing will cease operation after delivering up to 2 more loads (due to already-queued U-238 pieces inside the input queue of the Advanced Centrifuges.)\n\n**You don't need to prime the Advanced Centrifuges again to restart processing;** all required U-235 pieces are already standing by inside the Advanced Centrifuge. Just enable the top-left Fast Inserter of each unit, and after several seconds of grabbing U-238 pieces, the process will immediately start again.\n\n## Mods Needed\n\n* [**_Advanced Centrifuge_** by kiratu11](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/advanced-centrifuge)\n* [**_Miniloader_** by therax](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/miniloader)\n* [**_Change Inserter Drop Lane_** by raiguard](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ChangeInserterDropLane)",
