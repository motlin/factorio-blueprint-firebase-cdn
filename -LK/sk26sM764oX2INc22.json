  "descriptionMarkdown": "Have you wanted to combine two products onto one belt yet still utilize your bus to its full potential? Then look no further as the handy dandy 2 to 1 Combiner is here to rescue you from your misery!\n\nThis remarkable tool will gladly take in your two products and deliver them to you combined onto one belt. It will even give you 2 belts of combined products for the outrageous price of free! In addition, it will do its best to empty your input belts by taking product from the entire belt equally. Let’s hear it for magic!\n\nJust hook in one product into the splitter on the left (which will come out on the left side of the combined belt) and the other product into the splitter on the bottom (which will come out on the right side of the combined belt), and your reward is waiting for you from the splitter on the right.\n\nNow you may ask, eyesofdisarray, can I shove as much product as I can from two belts per input splitter? If you want to realize the full potential of this amazing device and laugh at your pitiful production, then you really have no choice but to take hold of that beast and push it right to the top of the mountain!\n\nBut eyesofdisarray, what if I’m really only concerned with inefficiency and want to put one product in either splitter so that my product will be on either side of the output belt? I can’t stop you from your dreams, but I can point you to something way more simple yet still incredible at what it does. Look for our other amazing product, the Shunter!",
