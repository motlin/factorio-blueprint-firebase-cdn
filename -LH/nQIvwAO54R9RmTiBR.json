Due to this many players have stopped using 4-way intersections as they can be inefficient. The loop design takes this idea a step further and rids itself of intersections all together. The banning of intersections means that we are only left with three types of rail section:\n\n* Merges: Two or more paths merging together into one track.\n* Splits: One track splitting into multiple paths.\n* Straight: May be a curve or a straight segment, simply has no splitting or merging.\n\nIn most single headed rail designs there are two rail sections running parallel (one for each direction), however a loop based system highly discourages doing this. Rather than have parallel lines running trains going in opposite directions, a loop based system is composed of large loops (thus the name).\n\n----\n##### Advantages and Disadvantages of loop based design.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* No intersections, and therefore less trains waiting for another train to pass. (this may not be true, would love if someone could devise a test)\n* All congestion comes from merges or train stops, making it easier for the user to identify and solve traffic jams.\n* Lack of intersections allows designs to be much simpler, leading to easier usage.\n* A railbook is not required.\n* Permanent jams (when a train is stuck and will never move again without intervention) are nearly impossible to create.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Can be a pain to setup initially as a single loop must be made for functionality rather than just a single line. \n* Loop railways can often use much more space then traditional rail setups.\n* Intersections can be very pretty, loop based railways tend not to be as aesthetically pleasing.\n\n--------\n\n##### How do I use a loop based design.\n\n1. Make an initial loop of track, making it fairly large is probably a good idea (at least one or two train lengths in each direction). When you start to use it you'll get a much better idea of how you want to do this.\n1. If there is a train stop that you want to connect to the network, simply make a split from the loop. Extend this new line until it reaches the desired train stop. Continue the line from the stop and back to the loop, creating a merge to join it back it. \n1. Never make intersections\n1. You can add extra loop into the network as shortcuts or new paths for branches. Building bypasses around each train stop is often a good idea.\n\n-------\n\n##### How to use this railbook.\n\nThere are only five parts in this book. The first three are pretty self explanatory.\n\n* Straight: A straight section of rail\n* Curve right: A right turn.\n* Curve left: A left turn.\n\nTo make a split, this three may be mixed as needed. For example to make a section that goes straight and splits off to the right do a curve right and straight section on top of each-other. All three can be placed in the same spot to create a three way split. This leads into the usage of the other two parts.\n\n* In right (unused): Never to be used by itself, however can be put on a Straight to create a merge from the right.\n* In left (unused): Never to be used by itself, however can be put on a Straight to create a merge from the left.\n\nIn addition to the above uses, the two of these could be overlapped on each-other or both of these and a straight to create other types of merges.\n\nMixing a merge and split in the same section of rail is discouraged in this rail-book, however as long as there is not an intersection everything should work fine.\n\n###### Details:\n\nSegments are to be aligned using the poles with lights around them. The inclusion of the radars and roboports is entirely optional, however the roboports are what the entire railway is centered around.\n\n-------\n\n##### Questions, clarifications, suggestions and critisims\n\nYou can reach me on Discord as Gerk#2306.
