  "descriptionMarkdown": "This is an experiment in cheap long trains. No megabases or robots needed. Even your first railworld mining outpost can be *ludicrous*!\n\n![ore](https://i.imgur.com/NlOzaLH.jpg)\n\n\n\n## 1. Theory by Example\n\nPicture a two-sided unloading station saturating 3 blue belts with green circuits from 1 cargo wagon. How many trains does it need?\n\n### 1.1 Short Solution\n\nA full cargo wagon fills the belt for `(200 items/slot) * (40 slots/wagon) / (40 items/second/belt) / (3 belts) = 66 seconds`. When properly balanced, the cargo wagon unloads into 12 chests in `24 seconds`. The station is only in use `36%` of the time, and you need about `1 train/minute` to saturate the outputs.\n\nHow many trains do you need? Say the trip from the circuit factory takes `136 seconds`. By [Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law), while the belts are saturated you'll need at least `(1/66 trains/second) * (136 seconds there + 136 seconds back + 24 seconds load + 24 seconds unload) ~= 4.8 trains`. Round it up to `5` to take into account acceleration, or `6` if your rail network sees congestion.\n\nIn case the output belts back up, you need a 6-wide, 2-long train stacker. That way if trains are saturated they won't spill onto your rail network.\n\n### 1.2 Longer Solution\n\nWhat if you like your trains [long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1Ue0FFrHY)?\n\nA larger station unloading 3 cargo wagons into 1 blue belt each would need `1 train/200 seconds` and need at least `1.6` trains in the system to saturate outputs. The stacker would be 2-wide, 4-long. \n\nAre those trains really long enough? What if you want to go longer?\n\n### 1.3 Longest Solution\n\nGo back to 1 cargo wagon. A `12 chest` buffer can store `14.4 wagons` of items. What if you have a long train you shift forward, wagon by wagon, until the buffer is full?\n\nIf the output belts are fully consumed during unloading, an additional `((24 seconds unload + 5 seconds inactivity + 2 seconds movement) / wagon) * (14.4 wagons) * (40 items / second) * (3 belts) / (200 items/slot * 40 slots/wagon) = 6.7 wagons` of room is cleared in the chest buffer. \n\nFrom incrementally approximating [Zeno's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise), it takes about `25 wagons` to *really* fill up the 12-chest buffer. They take `775 seconds`, but the buffer won't run out for `960 seconds` afterwards. The station is in use `45%` of the time (the car-by-car shifts cut into travel time compared to the short solution) and a train needs to arrive about every `28.9 minutes` to keep outputs saturated. You need two trains, and a 1-wide 40-long S-loop stacker to contain them when the output belts aren't being consumed. (Smaller than it sounds - see the 47-long one below.)\n\nWith a 2:1 wagon:locomotive ratio, the train is 8.2 chunks long and does not fit on one screen. At this ratio acceleration is identical to short trains - but it's so long it takes ages to clear intersections.\n\n![S-loop stacker, Big Bertha style](https://i.imgur.com/dZSZFht.jpg)\n\n## 2. Long Long Train\n\nYou can't actually align train stations to shfit *one* car forward. Maybe with some double-header shenanigans - but that's a pain to set up.\n\nThere *is* an easy, tileable way to set up arbitrary-length 2-car unloaders. The 90 degree turns pull 3 wagons forward, so for them you need to pad with a locomotive or a fluid wagon. Here:\n\n![tiles](https://i.imgur.com/E5a93xa.jpg)\n\n1. Set up a 2-wagon loader/unloader station.\n2. Tile additional stations after it using straight and 90 degree turn tiles.\n3. Build a train of the correct length. For turns, insert locomotives as padding if you can figure out how to fuel them. ;)\n4. Shift-left-click an orange or purple template-station, then shift-right-click to copy its name over odd pull-forward stations. Repeat the step for even ones in the alternate color.\n5. Set up a tedious but simple schedule as shown in the first picture. You only need to do this twice, for additional trains you can shift-click to copy and paste it.\n\nTa-da, you have a massive train! It will take a while to fill up and opens up your rail network to exciting new deadlocks, but at a couple of trips per hour the load will be very low.\n\nWork-in-progress, comments welcome.",
