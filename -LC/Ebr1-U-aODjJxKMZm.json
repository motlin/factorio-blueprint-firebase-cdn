  "descriptionMarkdown": "Example of finished product: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8lxA5LId9M\n\nSo since I started playing around in this game around 5 days ago, and I've been working with trying to detect enemies. I've seen a lot of people post blueprints using laser turrets and measuring the drop of an accumulator to do it. However, most of these blueprints are outdated, and factoriolayouts.com apparently isn't a site anymore (https://factoriolayouts.com/blueprint/convert ) so I can't convert them.\n\nThe others I've seen use mods that change the accumulators recharge rate and the offshore pump speed, both of which when I tried to convert to vanilla I failed horribly.\n\nDue to my failure with laser/accumulator designs , I instead went more simple and developed one using a Gun turret and measuring the amount of ammo in an iron chest, turns out this move made things a lot more easier as well as much faster and power efficent (doesn't misfire like the laser designs I made)\n\nSome info:\n\nPros :\n\n Gun turret uses no power while idle compared to the laser's 24 Kw (in general less power usage for this blueprint).\n\nMeans of detecting the gun fire are more accurate than laser to my experience.\n\nMade for vanilla. No mods.\n\nResets quicker than laser setup (fast inserter just refills the iron chest while lasers had to wait to recharge their accumulators).\n\n'Entire system' design is smaller than most 'entire system' laser blueprints.\n\nModular (haven't seen a modular laser one yet).\n\nEasily customize various components such as 'duration of red alert' with only one menu screen if any.\n\nSensors can all be connected to one red alert system. While this removes the ability to see which sensor is triggers, it does save resources and if the purpose for the system is the train (see below the cons) , as the train runs around the entire base, it only needs to know that a sensor triggered and no particulars.\n\nCons :\n\nUses ammo and electricity instead of only electricity (which is an issue for some base builds who went all laser).\n\nRange of gun turret is smaller, leaving less reaction time than a laser system.\n\nIf there's a lot of 'detecting' gun turrets drawing from one iron chest, the fast inserter... just won't be fast enough (imagine refilling an iron chest to 200 ammo by one inserter - could be fixed however in future iteration).\n\nMight be difficult to set up? (rebuilt it so many times I don't trust myself as a reliable means to tell).\n\nBy the way, the reason I am doing this is because of once base I started where the spitters just refused to come in range of the gun turrets for more than a second and kept sniping from weird angles. I got so sick of having to stop what I was doing to shoot them that I am going to build a train track (see the train module in the blueprint book) to run them all down into fine paste whenever they try- to do this I will have a 'battle train' (all black) which will be around 10 locomotives connected together using coal, which will run down the line at full speed when the 'red alert' is triggered by the (to no surprise) 'red alert trigger' in the blueprint book.\n\n** What do the modules look like? ** Here's the imgur page for those of you somehow not in the mood to open factorio just to see the blueprint: https://imgur.com/a/DFh5DmP\n\n** How to use it: ** check out this imgur page: https://imgur.com/a/1cDp0yr\n\nI'll upload the specifics of the decider combinators if people want them too.",
