  "descriptionMarkdown": "# Multimall Controller (Factorio 2.0)\nMultimall controller with hysteresis and build priorities.\n\n## Building\n\nConnect the red wire from the power pole to the assembler / foundry and enable \"Set Recipe\" there. Connect a circuit network containing the current inventory (content of a chest or a Roboport for the logistics network) to the green wire on the power pole. If you want to read the ingredients for requester chests, use the green wire to connect it to the assembler. See these examples.\n\n### Early train based mall\n\nUses wagon as storage. Requires a whole train stopped at a station to read wagon content. Supports two assemblers which is good to make intermediates without interrupting too much. Raw material delivery will probably happen by belts at this point. Use another circuit to limit inflow of source materials. I used this for hours in my game to produce all pipes, buildings, inserters, any many more until I moved to a bot based mall.\n\n[Early train mall](https://i.imgur.com/5GJ0YZR.png)\n\n### Logistics based assemblers / foundries\n\nReceives source materials from logistics network. Great on Vulcanus to make all belt products in a single foundry.\n\n[Assembler](https://i.imgur.com/yFAlsYu.png)\n\n[Foundry](https://i.imgur.com/Is2gfxM.png)\n\n## Configuring\n\nIn constant (1) set the minimum amount of products. If the inventory falls below this number, production will start.\n\nIn constant (2) set the maximum amount of products. Once started, the factory will keep producing until this amount of inventory is reached. Give a good margin here for products that are consumed by the factory in other products to avoid constant switching.\n\nIn constant (3) set the priority of each product. Lower number means higher priority. The factory will make the product with the highest priority (lowest number) that is currently scheduled for production. Ensure that intermediate products that are needed later have a higher priority (lower number) so they can interrupt the production if they run low.\n\nComes pre-configured with an example setup for belts.",
