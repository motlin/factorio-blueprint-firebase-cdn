  "descriptionMarkdown": "Countdown timer with pulse activation and pulse reset.  Has a light indicating status (green for countdown, red for off).  \n\nI use this to monitor the input/output of factories using beacons to shut off automatically when there is no movement of items; when belts are full or when there is no input resources.\n\n**How it works**\n\n* When it reads a pulse of any signal, it starts counting down\n* If it reads another pulse, timer is reset and countdown restarts\n* Light indicator is green when counting down and red when it is not\n* If signal is constant (i.e. belt on hold), timer will not start counting down until it reads nothing and output will remain green.\n\n**Setup**\n\n1.  Enter the number of seconds in the constant combinator (signal T).\n2. Attach a red wire to the power pole (also make sure it's powered) and attach that to a pulse signal such as a belt (on pulse) or an inserter (reading hand contents).  You can also attach it to a constant signal which will only cause the countdown to start when it reads nothing.\n3. Attach a red wire from either of the bottom two decider combinators to whatever you wish to use it for: \n * Left for green\n * Right for red\n * Or use a green wire on either to read both\n\n**Other Info**\n\n* Time (signal T) is based on *60 game ticks = 1 second*.  Signal rotates through three combinators so signal T is multiplied by 20 to account for the 3 tick cycle.\n*Because of the cyclical signal there is a 2 in 3 chance that, instead of resetting on pulse, it will start another timer trailing the current one.  This will not affect the functionality/purpose of this device.\n*If input signal is constant (i.e. belt on *Hold*), timer will always be on since it will constantly be resetting.\n\nIf anyone has a better version of this, or if you notice an issue, please let me know. I love feedback! ",
