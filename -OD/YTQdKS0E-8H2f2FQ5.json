  "descriptionMarkdown": "Tired of having to build a giant supermarket? I have the solution for you: the portable market. Simply input the material and the quantity you want into the constant combinator, and it will handle the rest, as long as you have the materials. But wait, you can also instruct it to create the materials. You can set lists in the combinator, and it will do it (it doesn't create items that require chemical plants). There are two versions: one has a red chest, and the other has a purple chest. The red one doesnâ€™t generate extra items but leaves the material to make the item in small quantities. The purple one generates one or two extra items until the robots place them in logistic chests. You will have to retrieve them there or set up a logistic request. (Errors or improvements are welcome since this is the second version)",
