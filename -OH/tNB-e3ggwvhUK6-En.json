  "descriptionMarkdown": "To add this to your reactor setup:\n1. First put this blueprint between your cryogenic plants cooling your flouroketone and your reactors (pumping from the cryogenic plants towards the reactors). \n2. Set the pump to filter some other liquid than cold flouroketone for now (this is just to keep it turned off during the initialisation). \n3. If you are adding this to a reactor setup that has been running before, you need to drain the system of plasma and hot flouroketone. \n4. Fill the storage tank with flouroketone (set an assembler beside it and empty barrels). Easiest is to just fill it to full (25 k) but in theory you could have it lower than this as long as you know how much is being added. \n5. Open the constant combinator and set the plasma output signal to the number of generators you have in your setup. If you have less than 25k flouroketone in your tank, you also need to change the cold flouroketone signal to match the flouroketone in your tank. \n6. Remove the filter from the pump. \n\nYou may need to change the values on the arithmethic combinators dealing with plasma signals for your specific setup, I believe the optimal settings here will vary a bit depending on how many pipes you have in your setup but the values in the blueprint should work fine for most setups.
