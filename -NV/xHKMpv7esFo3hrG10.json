  "descriptionMarkdown": "Originally posted [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FactorioBlueprints/comments/17co0jx/fully_beaconed_2k_per_second_sulfuric_acid_design/) by [XineOP](https://www.reddit.com/user/XineOP/).\n\n> I've designed my own production lines in the past, but usually they have been horrible cobbled-together messes where I throw in however many assemblers \"feels\" right, and usually I end up being extremely inefficient with space and beacons. Today I decided that, instead of just getting my sulfuric acid city block up and running, I would spend hours contemplating and re-doing designs until I found something I was satisfied with. This was the end result. It takes 4 blue belts of sulfur and one belt of iron, and theoretically outputs 2000 acid per second.\n\n> Now obviously, there are some major flaws that I couldn't seem to figure out a way around. The biggest one is that I could only fit 1 inserter on each of the inside belts, so more sulfur gets pulled from the outside belts and the lack of throughput on the inside belts technically bottlenecks the design from its theoretical maximum. As you can also see, the beacons are uneven. This shouldn't be too much of a problem as technically a fully beaconed design would take more than 4 belts of sulfur and more than 1200 water per chemical plant per second, but it still irks me. The last and most annoying problem is that the sulfuric acid recipe absolutely eats water, so I had to resort to a separate water input for each chemical plant, which means 6 offshore pumps.\n\n> I had a great time making this design, but I'd love to hear any feedback y'all may have, or easy improvements to the design that I may have overlooked!",
