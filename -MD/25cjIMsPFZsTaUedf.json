  "descriptionMarkdown": "Safe compact railway crossing\n\n- Note: takes wall+train damage, but ensures that the trains stop, even if they are going too fast (having a yellow sign), so keep a roboport nearby with repair tools + gates!\n- You can add more signs to the entrance (just connect with green wire and copy the entrance-sign with SHIFT-rightclick on the first sign, then SHIFT+leftclick on your added sign), to make a train 'see' the light somewhat earlier (you can experiment with that, or just don't bother)\n- You can connect multiple setups with each other (just add green wire)\n\nI have been testing this while running on Refined Concrete (+ 150% speed) with 8 exoskeletons active (+ ??? %), with Nuclear fuel in the trains, and full breaking force researched for trains. For the test, the trains were not stopping at a station, but constantly looping, so they always had full speed. The trains and walls took a lot of damage while testing, but I never got killed. The two signs in the middle look a bit ugly but are necessary, I tried to remove them but instantly got killed by the high-speed trains.",
