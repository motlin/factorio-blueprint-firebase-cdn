  "descriptionMarkdown": "A Redesigned version of my smart station. With thanks to DRY411S for his design and combinator programming ideas\n- Trains will arrive in station\n- goods will be unloaded according to the user specified settings (see label A. in the image)\n- once no more requested goods are found in train train is immediately forced out of station\n- once all requested goods are provided station shuts down to prevent more deliveries until stocks are used\n\nI added the robo-port to this blueprint as suggested but it is not needed for the station to operate (ie it could be belt fed)\n\nI have merged and uploaded 2 images, 1 clean and one with notes corresponding to what follows.\n\nIn addition to the basic station control system i have also added an ammo management section and basic ammo priority filter. (section 3) This section seen on the right hand side of the station is not necessary for the basic station to operate  and is attached to the existing network (left side) at 4 contact points without having to redesign the main control system (basically if you don't want it just remove all combinations including constants on the right hand side). The ammo section works by specifying a total amount of ammo (see label C) distributed across all relevant ammo types set by user (label D) and collecting the highest priority ammo (set by priority filter, label E) from the train first then filling the rest of the quota with what ever is left.  This system could be used for any good that has similar characteristics (although i think ammo is the only one that incurs obsolescence... maybe fuel but i use a different system for that) \n\nThe Main Control section works by check the levels in stock against the amount requested and then checks to see if the item is in the train. If the train contains nothing of use it is instructed to move on. (It should be noted that the train is set to move on when circuit network condition G = 1 (label F))\nThis is setup to operate on one inserter only (section 1). once the inserter grabs an item out of the train the item currently being processed is sent to the next section (section 2) and quantity's are checked against the user defined amounts (label B) then a number of extra inserters are engaged based on these values. This is to speed up unloading of larger quantities.  again everything in this section could be removed and either the inserters rewired to work in parallel or removed leaving just the 1 without affecting the basic operation of the station\n\nAlways looking to improve my designs so if you have suggestions please leave a comment\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that i have deliberately left out trash collection for now as im not yet sure how i want to handle it but the basic design has 4 chest slots left open for this purpose, these could be filled in with more unloading if necessary\n\nAlso if people are wondering why im using info from the station containers only and not the logistic network it is because for now im using this station in small applications where the only provider/storage chests are in the station and remotely placed Requester chests don't supply info to the logistic network totals and so they don't matter. This design can easily be switched to logistic by removing the links to the station chests and connecting them to a roboport instead, please note that you may need an extra decider combinator (each > 0 pass each) between the roboport and system input to filter out -ve values (haven't tested this) but if i have set it up right i think it will handle the -ve input fine.  Also note that if you are using section 3 there is more than one point of connection to the station chests.",
