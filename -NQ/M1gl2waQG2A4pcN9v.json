  "descriptionMarkdown": "For use with the launching end (https://factorioprints.com/view/-NQLzu_-ohqjSqYVYPAv). This is the receiving end for the cargo rocket logistics system. This portion handles the item buffer, setting requests, and sending signals back to the source planet.\n\nNotes:\n1. Each column of constant combinators determines the buffer and max number of items to deliver based on a multiplier. See below for an example of how to set them. Some tweaking will be necessary to start efficiently sending mostly full rockets as things are needed. \n2. If you are sending items from the receiving setup to a requester chest, make sure to enable \"Request from Buffer Chest\" checkbox so robots will pull from the buffer.\n3. Can easily be converted to work in space. Only difference is using space belts/pipes,\n\nDetails:\n\n\tInputs: \n\t\t- Remote Logistics network requests\n\t\t- Local Logistics network contents\n\t\t- Buffer size for each requested item - Constant Combinator inputs\n\t\t- Recieve Quantity for each item - values of the constant combinator after multiply factors (x2, x4, x8...)\n\t\t- Contents of landing pad\n\n\tParameters:\n\t\t- We want a buffer of any requested items so that we dont stall with 0 of an item at the location. The buffer needs to be able to be used by the main logistics network, but not count towards the total items in logistics network.\n\t\t\t-Buffer = 6x6 buffer chest\n\t\t\t-Buffer chest connects to constant combinators specifying buffer size\n\t\t- Constant Combinators connect to X2, X4, X8, and X16 multipliers for the amount of items to send. Larger multipliers can be used for items you need more of.\n\t\t\t- Small amount, small multiplier - We dont use the item often and when we do, we only need  a small amount. Think rocket silos or anything with a stack size of 1.\n\t\t\t- Small amount, large multiplier - The item is constantly used but only in smaller quantities. Think roboports during expansion, Set buffer to 20 with a x16 multiplier. You will always have 20 roboports which should be plenty until the 320 arrive.\n\t\t\t- Large amount, small multiplier - We dont use these that often, but when we do, we need a bunch of them all at once. Think Science packs, solar panels for expanding power, belts, most buildings, etc... You always have enough for a big burst like researching or expanding, but you dont keep so much around that it sits there filling your storage. Idea is you would use a bunch all at once, and then your factory has time to replenish it.\n\t\t\t- Large amount, large multiplier - WE NEED ALL OF THE THINGS! Think commonly and constantly consumed resources and items like circuts, heat shielding, rails/rail parts, raw resources\n\t\t- When the amount of an item in the logistic network minus the amount in buffer plus a small fraction of the buffer size (showing it's actually using the buffer and not replenishing) is less than or equal to 0, send a low signal (Yellow) to sending side. Signal count is number of low items.\n\t\t\t- Example: \n\t\t\t\t-We request 100 pipes behind a x4 multiplier. we have 150 pipes on the logistics network. 50 in storage and 100 in the buffer. \n\t\t\t\t- The cargo rocket on the other side will have loaded (100*4-50) or 350 pipes. \n\t\t\t\t- We now construct something that takes 60 pipes. The first 50 get pulled from either the storage or buffer, but since storage is greater than 0, no signal is sent. Anything taken at this point from the buffer will be replenished from storage until full.\n\t\t\t\t- The last 10 pipes mean there are now only 90 pipes in the buffer and it isnt getting replenished as logistics storage is empty. \n\t\t\t\t- If((# of items in logistics == 0) AND (item count from buffer chest is 90% capacity or less)) Then send a YELLOW signal.\n\t\t\t\t- Out logistics storage is 0 and we have 90 pipes in the buffer when we request 100 (from constant combinator prior to multiplying). This is 90% or less so we send a YELLOW signal\n\t\t- We should only send the request signal if we are sending a yellow or red. The buffer should fill soon after the rocket lands so we dont immediatly start loading another rocket with items as bots put them away or use them. \n        - If both the buffer and logistics network have 0 of an item, send an Empty (Red) signal. [TODO - Check if this is working, seems to be sending even when there is items in buffer]\n\t\t- For each item, send deficit signal (Amount to send from multiplied combinator amount - current logistics network amount - amount in landing pad.)\n\t\t\t- Example: We want a buffer of 200 pipes, and put it behind the x4 multiplier. We currently have 350 pipes in the network and just delivered a nearly full rocket carying 12 pipes that have yet to unload from the landing pad. We send a signal of ((200*4)-350-12) or 438. If this was a new addition to the requests, 200 of the 350 available pipes will be placed into the buffer, increasing the amount that would be requested to 638 since the buffer contents dont count.\n\nSignals:\n\t- Yellow - Number of items that are low, but still have items in the buffer\n\t- Red - Number of items that have completly run out and need to be refilled immediatly.\n\t- Request count - Number of each needed item.\n\t\t- Should filter out any negative values or items on the network that are not actually requested to keep troubleshooting easier",
