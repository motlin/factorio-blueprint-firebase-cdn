  "descriptionMarkdown": "Here is a Simple and Infinitely Stackable Research Lab Print I modified from some of the other more complicated belt weaving ones that I thought I would share. It is set up now with three columns and fast inserters. But it can easily be done with inserters for the early game and/or narrowed to two columns or widened to 4 columns... you can decide. In addition, it is stackable as much as you want or need. In the late game you could simply add a 4th inserter at the base and a requester chest for space packs but it also can be belted if you desire. Give it a try and let me know what you think. Thanks and have a great day!",
